    "## Introduction\n",
    "In digital communities and forums on the internet, users often choose to remain anonymous as real names are not required when conversing with strangers online. With this anonymity comes the freedom to express one's thoughts without fear of being judged or recognized, yet this might also mean that users are free to say abusive sentiments with little to no repercussions. While most online forums and social media sites have various ways to moderate (e.g. moderators and staff that manually review posts and comments, a report button under messages, voting for comments and posts), these methods are not enough to combat the significant number of toxic comments made.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, ways to automate checking for toxicity in online text should be improved to foster a safe and respectful online environment."

    "The [`Toxic Comment Classification Challenge`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview) is a Kaggle challenge by the [`Conversation AI team`](https://conversationai.github.io/), which is composed of researchers from both [`Jigsaw`](https://jigsaw.google.com/) and `Google`. This challlenge invites participants to build a multi-headed model that can accurately detect the types of toxicity (i.e.,toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate) better than Perspectiveâ€™s [current models](https://github.com/conversationai/unintended-ml-bias-analysis).\n",
